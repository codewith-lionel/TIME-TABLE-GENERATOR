ALGORITHM DETAILS
================================================================================

CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION APPROACH
--------------------------------
Hard Constraints (MUST be satisfied):
  1. No teacher clash - teacher in only one place at a time
  2. Teacher daily limit - cannot exceed max hours per day
  3. Subject coverage - exact weekly hours scheduled
  4. Class slot uniqueness - one subject per slot

Soft Constraints (SHOULD be optimized):
  1. Teacher day preferences - prefer certain days
  2. Teacher time preferences - morning/afternoon
  3. Subject priorities - HIGH gets best slots
  4. Distribution - spread across days
  5. Avoid consecutive - same subject

PREFERENCE SCORING MECHANISM
----------------------------
Each potential slot receives a score:
  • Teacher preferred day:        +50 points
  • Teacher time slot match:      +30-40 points
  • HIGH priority in morning:     +20 points
  • New day for subject:          +10 points
  • Consecutive slot:             -10 points

Algorithm selects highest-scoring valid slot.

GENERATION ALGORITHM FLOW
--------------------------
1. Initialize teacher availability matrix (global)
2. Sort allocations by priority (HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW)
3. For each subject hour:
   a. Find all valid slots (check hard constraints)
   b. Score each valid slot (soft constraints)
   c. Select best slot
   d. Update availability matrix
   e. Increment daily hours counter
4. Return complete timetable or error

TIME COMPLEXITY: O(S × D × H)
  S = subject-hours to schedule
  D = day orders
  H = hours per day

SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(T × D × H + C × D × H)
  T = teachers
  C = classes
